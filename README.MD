**1.0 Data Ingestion.ipynb:** Loading word embeddings into dictionaries and pickling.

**1.1 Preprocessing.ipynb:**

* POS tagging for removing proper nouns like countries, nationalities, and brands.
* Removing special characters
* Lemmatisation
* Choosing most frequently used words
* Removing names using a list of common names

**2.1 - 2.5 Translation:** Attempts at translation of word embeddings. Finally, uploading the embedding keys as a document to Yandex Translate was found to be more efficient.

**3.0 Transliteration.ipynb:** Transliterating words in Indian languages from their native scripts to the Roman script. Removing definitive (le, la, lâ€™ and les) and partitive (du, de la, des, de l', de, d') articles from French words.

**4.0 Phonetic Matching.ipynb:** Calculating the Double Metaphone encodings for the words and matching words with similar encodings, i.e., cognates, onto a new embedding space

**5.0 Clustering Experiments.ipynb:** Experimenting with hyperparameter values of various clustering algorithms.

**clustering.py:** Contains functions for running the above experiments.

**5.1 Clustering Optimal.ipynb:** Clustering on the language pair embeddings using the optimal hyperparameter values obtained in the previous notebook.

**clustering_optimal_algos.py:** Contains functions for optimal clustering.
